# COLOR-GAME
A fun and interactive browser-based game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, where users test their ability to quickly recognize colors â€” not by the word shown, but by the *color of the text*.
## Game Objective
Type the **color of the text** (not the word itself) as quickly as you can before the timer runs out!  
This game challenges your concentration and processing speed.
## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/color-game.git
